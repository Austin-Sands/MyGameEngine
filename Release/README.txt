My game engine is very simple so far. I decided to use SDL2 and C++ as this is the coding language that I feel I have the best skills and understanding in. 
Unfortunately, this was posted late. I was pushing myself to get the bounding on my projectiles to delete the projectile after leaving the screen, I was having a really hard time not messing up the code. I appreciate your time in looking at my work.

Some of the code I used can be referenced to SDL tutorials I completed on lazyfoo.net
