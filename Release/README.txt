~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I based my final project game on the engine that I already started for this class. I expanded on the implementation a bit but not as much as I would have liked. 
I had the intention of adding two more mechanics to the game including a flashlight that would slowly die and proportionaly increase enemy spawn rate/speed as well as darken the screen so you lose visibility. 
Along with this I wanted to add battery pickups and a score that would also scale with the battery mechanic.

As it stands, the game is meant to be a timed survival. You have three minutes before a rescue helicopter arrives, you have to survive the alien invasion.

Some of the code I used can be referenced to SDL tutorials I completed on lazyfoo.net
